# actus-core-py

ACTUS protocol python implementation.  

N.B. Much of the code has been generated using the actus-mp code generation library.

## Status

This library is very much WIP and should NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS !  Once the unit tests can be sucessfully run against the official `actus-tests` test fixtures then:

1. The library status will be updated.
2. This README will be updated.
3. A notification will be sent to interested parties.
4. The library will be published upon pypi.
