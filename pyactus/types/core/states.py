    A data structure representing various states of a contract.  The states of a 
    contract contain important information used when evaluating payoff. Furthermore, 
    states themselves contain atomic analytical elements such as the nominal value 
    or accrued interest for a lending instrument. On the other hand, states are 
    updated throughout an instrument's lifetime through evaluation of state 
    transition function in the various contract events.
